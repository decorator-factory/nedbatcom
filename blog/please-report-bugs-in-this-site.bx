<p><b>tl;dr:</b> If you see something wrong on my site,
<a href="/site/aboutned.html">please let me know</a>. I won't be annoyed or
offended.  You'll be helping me. It's a contribution.</p>

<p>This morning I tweeted out a link to my
<a pref='blog/latos-unfortunate-ligatures.bx'/> blog post.  ≈Åukasz Langa tweeted
back at me:</p>

<figurep href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1254725584028160000">
    <img src="pix/lukasz_tweet.png" class="hairline"
        alt="This is low pri but since we're already nitpicking: your website's design doesn't do image resizing proportionally. That's how it looks on the iPhone in horizontal mode (vertical is worse)."
    />
</figurep>

<p>OMG! Are images looking like that on my site and I didn't know? (I've since
fixed the problem.) Turns out it wasn't just iPhones: Safari on desktop also
showed stretched images like this!  Why didn't anyone tell me?</p>

<p>I could have done more thorough testing to begin with, but bugs will happen
no matter what.</p>

<p>If you see something wrong, <a href="/site/aboutned.html">get in touch</a> to
let me know.  As a creator, I want to make good things.  If you can point me to
a problem, you are helping me make better things.  Even small things like
dropped words or mispellings are good to report (see what I did there?).</p>

<p>I know it might feel like you are being a nit-picker, but it shows me that
you care enough about what I do to respond.  It's a good thing. Probably other
blog authors feel the same way.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
